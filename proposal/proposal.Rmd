# Create new needed variables

# Create plot to examine height to weight ratios and how they vary between sexes and medalwinners and non-medalwinners, and then comparing these trends across sports

#TODOS: see what's going on with ice hockey (looks like only males, and only medalwinners) and figure skating (looks like only medalwinners, but both sexes are still represented.)

ideas: 
-relationship between GDP etc
-which olympics do athletes do best in (i.e. when they participate in multiple, typical peak performance?)

## Dataset

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

## Analysis plan

A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
